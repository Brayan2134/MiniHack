# MiniHack
 This is my official submission for the CPP MiniHack 2023. Programmers were given 2.5 hours to complete 3 levels of difficulty, each with different variations on the same problem -- to learn and use the OpenAI API.

 # Levels
1. Use Python and the GPT API to create a conversation in the terminal. (Complete)
2. Use a Python GUI Library to create an interactive version of the program. (Complete)
3. Create a web application with Node.js that links to the Python source file to call and request GPT commands. (Out of time)
